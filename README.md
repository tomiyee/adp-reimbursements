# ADP Reimbursements

This is a full-stack MERN intended to help track expenses and reimbursements at the MIT chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.

Users will be able to record their expenses on the application, as well as accompanying receipts. The users will then be able to generate a single pdf that will contain the itemized list of expenses, a lit of the signatures that need to be acquired, and the various receipts.
